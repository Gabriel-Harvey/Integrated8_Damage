# Integrated-Project
I totally didn't borrow stuff from this youtube link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdlL5bwbCiI
I just kept it simple so we can show it off for next week. Since we don't have sprites yet you could just add a ball on the ball to show what would happen? 
Let me know if you're confused about anything.
